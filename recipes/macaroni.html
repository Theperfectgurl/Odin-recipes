    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
        Macaroni Salad with Pickles is a delightful dish that combines tender macaroni pasta with a creamy dressing,
         complemented by the tangy crunch of pickles. It's typically mixed with mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar,
          and seasonings, creating a creamy yet zesty flavor profile. The addition of pickles adds a refreshing bite, 
          balancing the creaminess with a hint of acidity and crunch.
         This salad is perfect for picnics, potlucks, or as a refreshing side dish on a warm day.</p>

         <ol>
            <li>Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling water until al dente. Drain; rinse with cold water. Set aside.</li>

            <li>In a large bowl, combine drained pasta, celery, onion, olives, sweet pickles, carrots, green pepper, and chopped eggs. Stir in dressing, and mix well. Refrigerate before serving.</li>
